# Coogle Forms
A survey form system. (WIP)

### Demo application and feedback
## Built using 
- ReactJS and MaterialUI (frontend)
- NodeJS, XLJS library (backend)

- Run the `docker-compose.yaml` that builds the frontend and backend by typing `docker-compose up --build`
- Visit `localhost:3000` on your browser

## Stretch Goal B
To handle a potential surge in traffic for a survey form system, frontend, backend, infrastructure, and scalability considerations should be taken into account. (non-exhaustive)

1. **Frontend Optimization:**
    - Implement lazy loading for components that are not immediately visible (eg. a long form with multiple sections) to reduce the initial load time.
2. **Backend Scaling:**
    - Horizontal scaling of backend servers by adding more servers to cache usersâ€™ responses and load balancers to distribute the incoming traffic across servers in times of high traffic
    - Implement rate limiting and request validation to protect servers from abusive requests during a surge.
3. **Database Considerations:**
    - Use non-relational DBs that scale well like NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) or scalable SQL databases (e.g., Amazon Aurora, Google Cloud Spanner).
    - Cache user responses to reduce the load of writing each response immediately into the primary database.
