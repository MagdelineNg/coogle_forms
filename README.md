Anyone can be directed to the user form and fill up their response.

Click on "Responses" tab to view panel displaying total number of responses. Responses stored in an Excel file with the form name as its name. Excel file is retrievable in `./src/backend/responses` now)

Navigate to the directory where the Excel file is at(shown in "Responses" tab panel) to view all responses.

## Getting started:
- Clone this repository or fork it
    - To clone this repository type git clone `https://github.com/MagdelineNg/coogle_forms.git` on your command line
    - To fork this repository, click fork button of this repository then type git clone `https://github.com/<your username>/coogle_forms.git`
- Ensure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) is installed on your local computer. 
- Run the `docker-compose.yaml` that builds the frontend and backend by typing `docker-compose up --build`
- Visit `localhost:3000` on your browser

## Stretch Goal B
To handle a potential surge in traffic for a survey form system, frontend, backend, infrastructure, and scalability considerations should be taken into account. (non-exhaustive)

1. **Frontend Optimization:**
    - Implement lazy loading for components that are not immediately visible (eg. a long form with multiple sections) to reduce the initial load time.
2. **Backend Scaling:**
    - Horizontal scaling of backend servers by adding more servers to cache usersâ€™ responses and load balancers to distribute the incoming traffic across servers in times of high traffic
    - Implement rate limiting and request validation to protect servers from abusive requests during a surge.
3. **Database Considerations:**
    - Use non-relational DBs that scale well like NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) or scalable SQL databases (e.g., Amazon Aurora, Google Cloud Spanner).
    - Cache user responses to reduce the load of writing each response immediately into the primary database.
